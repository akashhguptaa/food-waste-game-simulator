## 🎯 Game Scenarios

### 🏃‍♂️ Scenario 1: The Marathon Dinner

**Setting:** You just ran 10 km for a charity marathon and you're starving.  
**Challenge:** The dinner buffet looks amazing — rice, curry, salad, dessert, and juice. How much should you actually take?

**🍽️ Food Options:** Rice, Curry, Salad, Juice, Dessert  
**🧠 Logic:** The player needs a moderate portion of carbs and protein, but not too much dessert or juice.

### 📚 Scenario 2: The Study Marathon

**Setting:** You've been studying for 6 hours straight for tomorrow's test.  
**Challenge:** Your mom just brought snacks — chips, sandwich, smoothie, and fruits. Choose wisely, because your brain's tired, but your body isn't.

**🍽️ Food Options:** Sandwich, Smoothie, Chips, Fruits  
**🧠 Logic:** The player should choose balanced snack portions; too many chips count as waste or poor nutrition.

### 🎬 Scenario 3: The Movie Night Feast

**Setting:** It's Friday night and your friends are over for a movie marathon.  
**Challenge:** Everyone ordered pizza, popcorn, and soda — but not everyone eats the same. Decide how much you'll take without wasting food.

**🍽️ Food Options:** Pizza, Popcorn, Soda  
**🧠 Logic:** It's a social event; temptation is high, but the real need is lower than expected.

### 🏔️ Scenario 4: The Mountain Adventure

**Setting:** You've been hiking up a hill since morning and finally reach a campfire site.  
**Challenge:** Dinner time! You have soup, bread, and roasted vegetables to pick from. Don't waste — remember you carried this food up the mountain.

**🍽️ Food Options:** Soup, Bread, Roasted Vegetables  
**🧠 Logic:** The player needs energy but resources are limited, so realistic consumption is key.

### 🎂 Scenario 5: The Birthday Bash

**Setting:** It's your birthday and you're at your favorite restaurant with cake, pasta, and ice cream.  
**Challenge:** Excitement can lead to over-ordering — make your plate wisely.

**🍽️ Food Options:** Pasta, Cake, Ice Cream, Juice  
**🧠 Logic:** Celebration scenario; moderate portions prevent waste and overindulgence.

### 🛋️ Scenario 6: The Lazy Sunday

**Setting:** It's a lazy Sunday afternoon. You've done absolutely nothing all day.  
**Challenge:** You're about to order lunch — burger, fries, and milkshake. Do you really need all that, or just something light?

**🍽️ Food Options:** Burger, Fries, Milkshake  
**🧠 Logic:** Low activity means low energy requirement, so smaller portions are ideal.
